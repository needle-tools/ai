  is working with Needle Engine components, GLB files exported from Unity or Blender,
  Vite configs with needlePlugins, TypeScript classes extending Behaviour, or anything
  involving @needle-tools/engine imports. Also trigger when the user mentions
  "needle engine", "needle tools", serializable decorators (@serializable, @syncField,
  @registerType), the <needle-engine> web component, or 3D scenes loaded from GLB
  in a web context — even if they don't explicitly name the engine.

# Needle Engine

You are an expert in Needle Engine — a web-first 3D engine built on Three.js with a component system and Unity/Blender-based workflow.

## Quick Start

```html
<needle-engine src="assets/scene.glb"></needle-engine>
<script type="module">
  import "@needle-tools/engine";
</script>
```

Minimal TypeScript component:
```ts
import { Behaviour, serializable, registerType } from "@needle-tools/engine";

@registerType
export class HelloWorld extends Behaviour {
  @serializable() message: string = "Hello!";

  start() {
    console.log(this.message);
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ **TypeScript config required:** `tsconfig.json` must have `"experimentalDecorators": true` and `"useDefineForClassFields": false` for decorators to work. Without `useDefineForClassFields: false`, TypeScript overwrites `@serializable()` properties with their default values *after* the decorator runs, silently breaking deserialization.

---

## Key Concepts

**Needle Engine** ships 3D scenes from Unity or Blender as GLB files and renders them in the browser using Three.js. TypeScript components attached to objects are serialized into the GLB and re-hydrated at runtime.

- **Unity workflow:** C# MonoBehaviours → auto-generated TypeScript stubs → GLB export on play/build
- **Blender workflow:** Components added via the Needle Engine Blender addon → GLB export with component data embedded
- **Embedding:** `<needle-engine src="assets/scene.glb">` web component creates and manages a 3D context
- **Context access:** use `onStart(ctx => { ... })` or `onInitialize(ctx => { ... })` lifecycle hooks (preferred); `document.querySelector("needle-engine").context` works but only from UI event handlers

### `<needle-engine>` Attributes

Boolean attributes can be disabled with `="0"` (e.g. `camera-controls="0"`).

```html
<needle-engine
  src="assets/scene.glb"
  camera-controls
  auto-rotate
  autoplay
  background-color="#222"
  environment-image="studio"
  contactshadows
></needle-engine>
```

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `src` | GLB/glTF file path(s) — string, array, or comma-separated |
| `camera-controls` | Adds default OrbitControls with auto-fit if no `OrbitControls`/`ICameraController` exists in the root GLB. Disable with `="0"` for fully custom camera. To tweak defaults, get `OrbitControls` from the main camera in `onStart` |
| `auto-rotate` | Auto-rotate the camera (requires `camera-controls`) |
| `autoplay` | Auto-play animations in the loaded scene |
| `background-color` | Hex or RGB background color (e.g. `#ff0000`) |
| `background-image` | Skybox URL or preset: `studio`, `blurred-skybox`, `quicklook`, `quicklook-ar` |
| `background-blurriness` | Blur intensity for background (0–1) |
| `environment-image` | Environment lighting image URL or preset (same presets as `background-image`) |
| `contactshadows` | Enable contact shadows |
| `tone-mapping` | `none`, `linear`, `neutral`, `agx` |
| `poster` | Placeholder image URL shown while loading |
| `loadstart` / `progress` / `loadfinished` | Callback functions for loading lifecycle |

## Unity → Needle Cheat Sheet

| Unity (C#) | Needle Engine (TypeScript) |
|---|---|
| `MonoBehaviour` | `Behaviour` |
| `[SerializeField]` / public field | `@serializable()` (required for all serialized fields) |
| `Instantiate(prefab)` | `instantiate(obj)` |
| `Destroy(obj)` | `destroy(obj)` |
| `GetComponent<T>()` | `this.gameObject.getComponent(T)` |
| `AddComponent<T>()` | `this.gameObject.addComponent(T)` |
| `FindObjectOfType<T>()` | `findObjectOfType(T, ctx)` |
| `transform.position` | `this.gameObject.worldPosition` (world) / `this.gameObject.position` (local) |
| `transform.rotation` | `this.gameObject.worldQuaternion` (world) / `this.gameObject.quaternion` (local) |
| `transform.localScale` | `this.gameObject.worldScale` (world) / `this.gameObject.scale` (local) |
| `Resources.Load<T>()` | No direct equivalent — use `@serializable(AssetReference)` to assign refs in editor, then `.instantiate()` or `.asset` at runtime |
| `StartCoroutine()` | `this.startCoroutine()` (in a component; unlike Unity, coroutines stop when the component is disabled) |
| `Time.deltaTime` | `this.context.time.deltaTime` |
| `Camera.main` | `this.context.mainCamera` (THREE.Camera) / `this.context.mainCameraComponent` (Needle Camera component) |
| `Debug.Log()` | `console.log()` |
| `OnCollisionEnter()` | `onCollisionEnter(col: Collision)` |
| `OnTriggerEnter()` | `onTriggerEnter(col: Collision)` |

## Three.js → Needle Cheat Sheet

| Three.js | Needle Engine |
|---|---|
| `new Mesh(geo, mat)` | Created in Unity/Blender, exported as GLB; access via `Renderer.sharedMesh` / `Renderer.sharedMaterials` |
| `scene.add(obj)` | `this.gameObject.add(obj)` or `instantiate(prefab)` |
| `scene.remove(obj)` | `obj.removeFromParent()` (re-parent) or `destroy(obj)` (permanent) |
| `obj.position` | `obj.position` (local) / `obj.worldPosition` (world — Needle extension) |
| `obj.quaternion` | `obj.quaternion` (local) / `obj.worldQuaternion` (world — Needle extension) |
| `obj.scale` | `obj.scale` (local) / `obj.worldScale` (world — Needle extension) |
| `obj.getWorldPosition(v)` | `obj.worldPosition` (getter, no temp vec needed) |
| `obj.traverse(cb)` | `obj.traverse(cb)` (same — it's Three.js underneath) |
| `obj.children` | `obj.children` (same) |
| `obj.parent` | `obj.parent` (same) |
| `raycaster.intersectObjects()` | `this.context.physics.raycast()` (auto BVH, faster) |
| `renderer.setAnimationLoop(cb)` | `update() {}` in a component, or `onUpdate(cb)` hook |
| `clock.getDelta()` | `this.context.time.deltaTime` |
| `new GLTFLoader().load(url)` | `AssetReference.getOrCreate(base, url)` then `.instantiate()`, or `loadAsset(url)` |

Needle Engine extends `Object3D` with component methods (`getComponent`, `addComponent`, `worldPosition`, `worldQuaternion`, `worldScale`, `worldForward`, `worldRight`, `worldUp`, `contains`, etc.). `this.gameObject` is the `Object3D` a component is attached to. The underlying Three.js API still works directly.

## Creating a New Project

```bash
npm create needle my-app                  # Vite (default)
npm create needle my-app -t react         # React + Vite
npm create needle my-app -t vue           # Vue + Vite
npm create needle my-app -t sveltekit     # SvelteKit
npm create needle my-app -t nextjs        # Next.js
npm create needle my-app -t react-three-fiber  # R3F
```

---

## Vite Plugin System

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { needlePlugins } from "@needle-tools/engine/vite";

export default defineConfig(async ({ command }) => ({
  plugins: [
    ...(await needlePlugins(command, {}, {})),
  ],
}));
```

---

## Deployment

- **Needle Cloud** — `npx needle-cloud deploy`
- **Vercel / Netlify** — standard Vite web app
- **itch.io** — for games
- **Any static host / FTP** — `npm run build` (or `npm run build:production`) produces a standard dist folder

From Unity, built-in deployment components (e.g. `DeployToNetlify`) require a PRO license. Needle Cloud deployment works with the free tier.

---

## Networking

Needle Engine networking has three layers — use the highest-level one that fits your needs:

### Layer 1: `context.connection` (low-level)
The core API for WebSocket rooms and messaging. Everything else builds on this.
```ts
this.context.connection.connect();
this.context.connection.joinRoom("my-room");

// Send and receive custom messages
this.context.connection.send("my-event", { data: 42 });
this.context.connection.beginListen("my-event", (msg) => { console.log(msg.data); });
this.context.connection.stopListen("my-event", handler);  // clean up in onDisable/onDestroy
```

**Persistent vs ephemeral messages:** If the message data includes a `guid` field, the server stores it as room state — new users joining later will receive it. Without a `guid`, messages are fire-and-forget (only delivered to currently connected users).
```ts
// Ephemeral — only current users receive this
this.context.connection.send("chat", { text: "hello" });

// Persistent — stored on server, sent to users who join later
this.context.connection.send("object-color", { guid: this.guid, color: "#ff0000" });

// Delete persisted state when no longer needed
this.context.connection.sendDeleteRemoteState(this.guid);
```

### Layer 2: `SyncedRoom` (convenience component)
Wraps `context.connection` with auto-join (via URL params), random room names, auto-reconnect, and a join/leave UI button. Add it to any object in the scene — no code needed for basic room management.
```ts
// In Unity/Blender: add SyncedRoom component to a GameObject
// Or create at runtime:
import { SyncedRoom } from "@needle-tools/engine";
myObject.addComponent(SyncedRoom, { roomName: "my-room" });
// or join a random room:
myObject.addComponent(SyncedRoom, { joinRandomRoom: true });
```

### Layer 3: `PlayerSync` + `PlayerState` (player management)
Automatically instantiates a prefab for each player that joins, and destroys it when they leave. The prefab must have a `PlayerState` component. Used for WebXR avatars and multiplayer player objects.
```ts
import { PlayerSync, PlayerState } from "@needle-tools/engine";

// In Unity/Blender: add PlayerSync component, assign a player prefab asset
// The prefab should have PlayerState + any synced components (SyncedTransform, etc.)

// Or set up at runtime:
const ps = await PlayerSync.setupFrom("assets/player-avatar.glb");
scene.add(ps.gameObject);

// Check if an object belongs to the local player:
if (PlayerState.isLocalPlayer(someObject)) { /* this is ours */ }
```

### Syncing object transforms: `SyncedTransform`
Add `SyncedTransform` to any object that should have its position/rotation synced across clients. Ownership is automatic — when a user interacts (e.g. via `DragControls`), they take ownership and their changes broadcast to others.

### Syncing custom state: `@syncField()`
```ts
@syncField() score: number = 0;          // auto-syncs on reassignment
@syncField(MyClass.prototype.onHealthChange)
health: number = 100;                     // sync + callback

// Arrays/objects: mutation doesn't trigger sync — must reassign
this.items.push("sword");
this.items = this.items;   // ← forces sync
```

### Typical multiplayer setup
1. `npm create needle my-app` — scaffold the project
2. Add `SyncedRoom` to an object (or call `context.connection.joinRoom()`)
3. For player avatars: add `PlayerSync` with a prefab that has `PlayerState`
4. For synced objects: add `SyncedTransform` to movable objects
5. For custom state: use `@syncField()` on component properties

---

## Progressive Loading (`@needle-tools/gltf-progressive`)

```ts
import { useNeedleProgressive } from "@needle-tools/gltf-progressive";
useNeedleProgressive(gltfLoader, renderer);
gltfLoader.load(url, (gltf) => scene.add(gltf.scene));
```

In Needle Engine projects this is built in — configure via **Compression & LOD Settings** in Unity.

## Searching the Documentation

Use the `needle_search` MCP tool to find relevant docs, forum posts, and community answers:

```
needle_search("how to play animation clip from code")
needle_search("SyncedTransform multiplayer")
needle_search("deploy to Needle Cloud CI")
```

Use this *before* guessing at API details — the docs are the source of truth.

## Common Gotchas

- `@registerType` is required or the component won't be instantiated from GLB. Unity/Blender export adds this automatically via codegen; hand-written components need it explicitly.
- GLB assets go in `assets/`, static files (fonts, images, videos) in `public/` (configurable via `needle.config.json`)
- `useDefineForClassFields: false` must be set in `tsconfig.json` — otherwise TypeScript overwrites decorated fields with their defaults after the decorator runs, silently breaking serialization
- `@syncField()` only triggers on reassignment — mutating an array/object in place won't sync. Do `this.arr = this.arr` to force a sync event.
- Physics callbacks (`onCollisionEnter` etc.) require a Needle `Collider` component (BoxCollider, SphereCollider ...) on the GameObject — they won't fire on mesh-only objects
- `removeComponent()` does NOT call `onDestroy` — any cleanup logic in `onDestroy` (event listeners, timers, allocated resources) will be skipped. Use `destroy(obj)` for full cleanup.
- `PlayerSync` prefab must have a `PlayerState` component — without it, the spawned instance will be immediately destroyed with an error. In Unity/Blender, add PlayerState to the prefab root.
- Prefer the standalone `instantiate()` and `destroy()` functions over `GameObject.instantiate()` / `GameObject.destroy()` — the standalone versions are the current API
- `loadAsset()` returns a model wrapper (not an Object3D) — use `.scene` to get the root Object3D
- `AssetReference.getOrCreateFromUrl()` caches by URL — loading the same URL twice returns the same Object3D. Use `.instantiate()` or `loadAsset()` with `{ context }` for multiple independent copies
